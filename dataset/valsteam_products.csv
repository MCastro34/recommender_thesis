These regulators, available with spring or dome-loading, are designed for use with clean steam, compressed air, water and other gases or liquids compatible with the construction materials and valve design.
P173;The ADCA P173 series direct acting, spring-loaded diaphragm sensing, pressure reducing valves are designed for use with clean steam, compressed air, water and other gases or liquids compatible with the construction materials.
BKR2;The ADCAPure BKR2 series of tank blanketing pressure reducing valve designed for millibar control in applications such as tank storage blanketing systems. Used to prevent and protect against explosion, control product contamination, reduce evaporation losses or internal tank corrosion and to prevent vacuum condition.
V928;The V928 are two- or three-way hygienic control valves with angle or in-line connections, specially designed for the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The valves are available with pneumatic diaphragm actuators and have been developed to ensure accurate control in any process condition.
V926A;The V926A are two-way aseptic control valves with angle connections, specially designed for the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The valves are available with pneumatic diaphragm actuators and have been developed to ensure accurate control in any process condition.
V926H;The V926H are two-way hygienic control valves with angle connections, specially designed for the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The valves are available with pneumatic diaphragm actuators and have been developed to ensure accurate control in any process condition.
SRV6;The ADCAPure SRV6 series aseptic safety relief valves with angle type connections are designed for use with clean steam, air, water and other gases and liquids compatible with the construction materials. Main applications are overpressure protection on steam equipment, pressure vessels and pipelines, particularly within the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries.
SWS;The SWS sanitary sight glasses are designed to monitor liquid flow in any direction. Sight glasses (or flow indicators) are usually employed to detect either the presence or absence of fluid flow, turbulence, colour, etc. They are specially recommended for high purity applications.
SRT10H;The SRT10 all stainless steel disc check valve has a compact design and is specially designed for use with clean steam, hot condensate and other process fluid applications. They are particularly recommended for high purity applications.
M3H;The ADCAPure M3H three-piece body ball valves are isolating valves designed for use with clean steam, condensate and other gases and liquids used in high purity and aseptic processes. Mainly designed for the pharmaceutical, biotech, semiconductor, cosmetics, fine chemical, food and beverage industries.
M3HP;The ADCAPure M3HP high purity three-piece body ball valves are isolating valves designed for use with clean steam, condensate and other gases and liquids used in high purity and aseptic processes. Mainly designed for the pharmaceutical, biotech, semiconductor, cosmetics, fine chemical, food and beverage industries.
S11;When wet steam is used in sterilization, moisture in suspension reduces the heat transfer efficiency, and the validity of the sterilization process can be compromised. The ADCAPure S11 series centrifugal separators remove moisture from steam pipelines. Steam passes through the separator and the particles with a heavier specific gravity are separated. Condensate collected at the bottom of the separator must be automatically drained through a suitable steam trap.
ISC20;The ISC20I high efficiency filters are used to remove contaminated particles from gases such as steam and compressed air. The optimized construction of these units offers high flow rates with minimum pressure loss.  All sizes are built in two halves, joined by a sanitary clamp ferrule, with drain connection on the bottom. The replaceable filter elements are made of sintered austenitic stainless steel.
